## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

Although, my code is a total mess. Still I manage to do the challenge smoothly. I am now comfortable in using Display: Grid; in my project. 

See below:


```css
.content .grids{
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
    margin: 1.5rem 0;
  }
  .content .grids .grid1 img{
    width: 65%;
    
  }
  .content .grids .grid2{
    text-align: left;
    margin-left: 0.5rem;

  }
  .content .grids .grid2 h3{
    font-weight: var(--fw-semi-bold);
    font-size: 13px;
    margin-top: 5px;
  }
  .content .grids .grid2 p{
    font-weight: var(--fw-regular);
    font-size: 13px;
    color: var(--clr-neutral-desaturated-blue);
  }
  .content .grids .grid3{
    text-align: center;
    margin: auto 0;
    font-size: 12px;
    font-weight: var(--fw-bold);
  }
```
